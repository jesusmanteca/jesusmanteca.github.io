                <p class="biodescription">
                    I was born in Guadalajara, in the heart of Mexico, surrounded by a large family, delicious food, and amazing culture. 
                    But only ten years later, our family moved to the United States in search for the American Dream. 
                    Although the move was rough, facing a new country, a 'foreign' language, new people, and new climate, it prepared me for a life full of changes.
                    Except high school, I never attended a school longer than two years, even in college. I went to Marquette University to study communications but after two years, 
                    I transferred to DePaul University where I earned a degree in psychology of human development.

                    After college, I studied health sciences at Loyola University, earning a post baccalaureate certificate and began working as a medical assistant in busy private practice at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
                    Several years later, I became the managing director of the practice but found there was missing something. I was more interested in why the patients wouldn't take their medicine than what the medicine did for them. 
                    That nagging question drove me to study people more closely and I entered the field of advertising.

                    I began my new career as a planner and strategist in a small multicultural ad agency, Elemento L2. My career subsequently took me to client side working with V&V Supremo, an award-winning Hispanic Midwestern Cheese company. 
                    After growing the company's social media presence through paid media, community managing, and strategy, I began to work with DDB in Chicago on national accounts like Miller Lite, Wyndham Hotels, AT&T, and ConAgra, among many other brands. 
                    I also became a community manager for the renowned agency.</p>
                 <p class="biodescription">
                    Two years later, I put my career on hold and along with my wife, we set off to travel, first to the Pacific Northwest and then to the Southwest in Arizona. 
                    That is the place I learned to make websites such as these.
